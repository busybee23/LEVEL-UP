### SOLUTION 1 : (Tabulation)

TIL : In last after forming whole dp array we need to take min of last two values because from last two we can take any steps either single step from last value or 2 step from second last, so last value can't be a answer, that why in the ending min is reqiured

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int size = cost.size();
        int dp[size+1];
        for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
            if(i<=1){
                dp[i] = cost[i];
                continue;
            }
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1],dp[i-2]) + cost[i];
        }
        return min(dp[size-1],dp[size-2]);
    }
};
```

### SOLUTION 2 : (Recursive)

TIL : n == cost.length was done to tackle last edge case where we will add nothing becuase it already outside (we arrive at outside the last cell ) rest will be added normally.
 
2. we are going from right to left or top to bottom 

```
    public int minCostClimbingStairs_memo(int[] cost, int n, int[] dp) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return dp[n] = cost[n];
        }

        if (dp[n] != 0)
            return dp[n];

        int fcall = minCostClimbingStairs_memo(cost, n - 1, dp);
        int scall = minCostClimbingStairs_memo(cost, n - 2, dp);
        int ans = Math.min(fcall, scall) + (n == cost.length ? 0 : cost[n]);

        return dp[n] = ans;
    }
```
